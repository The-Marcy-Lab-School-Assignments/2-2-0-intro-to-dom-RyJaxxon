# Question

Watch [this video on nodes and elements](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rhvec8cXLlo)

What is the difference between an HTMLCollections and NodeLists? Are they arrays?

# Answer

A NodeList will include all the nodes in our desired element, including any text, comments, and elements inside it.

An HTML collection will only include HTML elements in our desired element, this means anything like `<p>` or `<span>` is included while actual text and any comments are not.

Both of these lists are displayed in arrays!

# Teacher Feedback

So close! Your last sentence is incorrect, they are in array-like structures meaning that they too have content that could be accessed through indexing but they are **not** arrays!
