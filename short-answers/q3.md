# Question

What's the difference between `.innerText` and `.textContent`?

# Answer

Although both of these properties can access the text of an element:

`.innerText` includes CSS styling and takes into account hidden elements, skipping them.

`.textConent` displays all text, not caring for visibility or applying style. This generally makes it much faster.
