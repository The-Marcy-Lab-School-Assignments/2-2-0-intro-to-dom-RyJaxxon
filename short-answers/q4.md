# Question

When would you want to use `.innerHTML` to create some new html, and when would you want to use `.createElement` and node updates?

# Answer

If we had a static section of our page we knew would never change, we can use `.innerHTML`.

Though if we wish to say, display a list of our users achievements in a game, we could use the `.createElement` property to dynamically add the proper amount of achievements the player has to the a list element.
